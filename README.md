i am building this as a part of theodinproject curriculum, but not following any guides or looking at other people's codes or anything (consistent with all my other projects). Trying to use more functional componenents and hooks, my last project was class based with lifecycle methods, so we're branching out to explore this. possibly going to use an api or not, but it will be a memory game and hopefully it will be fun
